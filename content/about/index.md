I'm a career IT Professional living in Dallas, Texas. Overall, I have a broad background in enterprise IT as well as cloud computing. Currently, I work as a Enterprise Solutions Architect for [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/).

I am passionate about all things technology. When I'm not working to help some of the worlds' largest and most important customers migrate and manage workloads in the cloud, I also apply some of the same knowledge and principles to home IT management.

Outside of IT, I have come to appreciate the importance of staying physically active. [Crossfit](http://www.crossfit.com/) has become my main training regimine. The gains have allowed me to do things I would have once thought unthinkable for myself like running a half marathon.

## My travels

{{% travels %}}

The map above is places that I've spent meaningful time. It would be much longer if I included places where I had a connecting flight or was just driving through. That would make for an interesting data exercise, but unfortunately I don't have those data points and would probably miss something in the process.

I strongly believe that vacations and travel make for the best investments! Here's what I have planned for the future

- Copenhagen
- Milan to Lucern by train
- Croatia
- South Africa
- New Zealand
- Tasmania

## Photography

Being a technical person, photography lends itself to providing a creative outlet. I originally started my photographic journey in 2008 with the purchase of a Canon 40d. I also went through a phase where I wanted to travel light and made the move to a mirrorless Sony a6000. I finally got into the full-frame game with a Sony a7riii that is now my main camera. I haven't settled on a site (or method) for fully showcasing my work, but I do post pics from time-to-time on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ronnie.eichler/) account.
