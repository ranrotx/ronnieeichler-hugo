After a long hiatus (I think the last time I had a personal blog was back in college), I've decided to return. My reasons? Basically to give myself an outlet for writing long-form content. Also, during my last few years professionally, I've come across a lot of good technology and feel it would be great to contribute something back in the form of writing.

Also, a few other things have transpired. In my desire to migrate off of Gmail (there'll be another post on that later), I've registered my [domain](http://millennium.tech/). So of course, it felt natural once I had a domain to put a face on it so to speak. 

Lastly, a few other things have happened to make hosting a site such as this much easier. The last time I hosted a blog, it was running off of a VPS using cPanel. A lot has changed since then. I'm now hosting this off of [S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html) using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) so there is a lot less overhead with maintaining something like this.
